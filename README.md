The game consists of four colored buttons. The game randomly selects one of these buttons and lights it up while playing a corresponding sound. The player's task is to remember the sequence of button presses and repeat them in the correct order. After each successful round, the sequence is repeated with one additional button press added.

If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they have the option to restart and try again.
